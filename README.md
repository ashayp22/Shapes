# Shapes in C++

This is a basic command line Shape program I created using C++. The program can create Circle and Triangle objects, print them out, get their area, and destroy them.

It implements classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, dynamic casting, loops, arrays, virtual functions, and other concepts that I've started learning in C++.
